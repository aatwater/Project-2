#Objectives
In this module we will examine Discriminate Function Analysis, a pattern-recognition statistical method that characterizes or seperates two or more classes of objects or events. We will go over the different uses of DFAs, work through a basic example by hand in R, and will end with running an analysis together using actual data. 
## Key concepts: ??? 

#The Basics
Discriminate Function Analysis (DFA) is a populate statistical method
